Notes from ALS (who could not attend!)
- Excited for folks to meet Ale - use this time for introductions and context if helpful
- Considering a themed month of campaigning around accessibility this year - during the summer or autumn? Themed work during Collaboration Cafes or otherwise
- Starting an ACCESSIBILITY.MD file on Github - documentation for accessibility practices, and how we want to engage as a community
- Draw from slack policies: https://hackmd.io/@turingway/ttw-slack-intro

Campaigning for Accessibility: Instead of celebrate, show the right practices. Setting up good practices in real life

Liz 
- People interested in the topic
- Accessibility for people with disabilities: we do to make everyones opportunities equal and the idea of celebrating can be touch. It should be happening 
- Github will set up an improve accessibility. There's a position open for that.  
    
Andrea: Use the book dash to prove that we have 
- She will check if the Alt text from the Book Dash  was correct, the activity to improving the Alt Text, how to do better Alt text. 

Bookdash:
- she would like to see that next bookdash has normalised practices. 
- localisation and translation: making it part of the practice
- try to make the bookdash in the most accessible way
- guidelines about Slack usage
- links need to be at the top of messages
-  the activity to improving the Alt Text, how to do better Alt text. Avoid cultural language
- Bookdash recording and transcript and captions, we should leave them on.
- Data visualisation online: when people share their screen, that is not accessible. So slides should be shared in advance. 

Next Steps:
- Andrea will be able to help, plan for the pre book Dash Coordination. She will be in London from the 15 to 20 May
- Is Zenodo good for accessibility? / Liz will check 
- Jonny writes words: make sure that he uses the accessibility format
- Scriberia: live-audio description was done by Andrea - Ale, will raise this
